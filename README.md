# ðŸŽƒ Hallowkin

A simple Halloween-themed browser game where you catch falling pumpkins with your basket!

On the occaasion of Halloween, I thought of creating a Halloween based game so i created this in javascript, html and css.

In this game i had to learn collision detection by checking bounding boxes between pumpkins and the basket, managing a real-time game loop with 
requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations, and coordinating multiple setInterval timers for pumpkin spawning and countdown without memory leaks. 


I also figured out how to dynamically create and remove DOM elements while iterating backwards through arrays to avoid index errors, implemented the Web Audio API to
generate procedural sound effects using oscillators and gain nodes, and handled both keyboard and mouse input with proper coordinate transformations using getBoundingClientRect().

I struggled a lot but kept on learning and making this project.
